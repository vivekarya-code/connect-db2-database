# connect-db2-database
Code to connect to DB2 database via ODBC

# Assumptions
- This was coded for a Cloud Windows server to connect to a Db2 database and create wonders, just kidding!
- Config files and packages are in one flat structure here but in better places, real time.
- I had DEV, QA and PROD Cloud servers and DB2 environment was hence soft coded as seen in the connectDB2 code.
